For example, `|> Field.required ...` means we'll get a validation\nerror if that field is empty (similar for checking the minimum password length). This field definition defines\nsome information that will be used when render the field using [`Form.FieldView`](Form-FieldView) (whether it is a date input, password input, etc.).\n\nThere will be a corresponding parameter in the function we pass in to `Form.form` for every\nfield declaration (in this example, `\\email password passwordConfirmation -> ...`).\n\n**The `combine` validation**\n\nIn addition to the validation errors that individual fields can have independently (like\nrequired fields or minimum password length), we can also do _dependent validations_.\n\nWe use the [`Form.Validation`](Form-Validation) module to take each individual field and combine\nthem into a type and/or errors.\n\n**The `view`**\n\nIn your view you can lay out your fields however you want. While you will be using [`Form.FieldView`](Form-FieldView)\nto render the fields themselves, the rendering for everything besides the fields (including `label`'s, `div`s, etc.) is completely up to you.\n\n    import Form\n    import Form.Field as Field\n    import Form.FieldView as FieldView\n    import Form.Validation as Validation\n    import Html exposing (Html)\n    import Html.Attributes as Attr\n    import Route\n    import Server.Request as Request\n    import Server.Response exposing (Response)\n\n    type alias SignupForm =\n        { email : String\n        , password : String\n        }\n\n    signupForm : Form.HtmlForm String SignupForm () Msg\n    signupForm =\n        Form.form\n            (\\email password passwordConfirmation ->\n                { combine =\n                    Validation.succeed SignupForm\n                        |> Validation.andMap email\n                        |> Validation.andMap\n                            (Validation.map2\n                                (\\passwordValue confirmationValue ->\n                                    if passwordValue == confirmationValue then\n                                        Validation.succeed passwordValue\n\n                                    else\n                                        passwordConfirmation\n                                            |> Validation.fail\n                                                \"Must match password\"\n                                )\n                                password\n                                passwordConfirmation\n                                |> Validation.andThen identity\n                            )\n                , view =\n                    \\info ->\n                        [ Html.label []\n                            [ fieldView info \"Email\" email\n                            , fieldView info \"Password\" password\n                            , fieldView info \"Confirm Password\" passwordConfirmation\n                            ]\n                        , Html.button []\n                            [ if info.submitting then\n                                Html.text \"Signing Up...\"\n\n                              else\n                                Html.text \"Sign Up\"\n                            ]\n                        ]\n                }\n            )\n            |> Form.field \"email\"\n                (Field.text\n                    |> Field.required \"Required\"\n                )\n            |> Form.field \"password\"\n                passwordField\n            |> Form.field \"passwordConfirmation\"\n                passwordField\n\n    passwordField =\n        Field.text\n            |> Field.password\n            |> Field.required \"Required\"\n            |> Field.withClientValidation\n                (\\password ->\n                    ( Just password\n                    , if String.length password < 4 then\n                        [ \"Must be at least 4 characters\" ]\n\n                      else\n                        []\n                    )\n                )\n\n    fieldView :\n        Form.Context String input\n        -> String\n        -> Validation.Field String parsed FieldView.Input\n        -> Html msg\n    fieldView formState label field =\n        Html.div []\n            [ Html.label []\n                [ Html.text (label ++ \" \")\n                , field |> Form.FieldView.input []\n                ]\n            , (if formState.submitAttempted then\n                formState.errors\n                    |> Form.errorsForField field\n                    |> List.map\n                        (\\error ->\n                            Html.li [] [ Html.text error ]\n                        )\n\n               else\n                []\n              )\n                |> Html.ul [ Attr.style \"color\" \"red\" ]\n            ]\n\n\n## Building a Form Parser\n\n@docs Form, HtmlForm, StyledHtmlForm\n\n@docs form\n\n\n### Adding Fields\n\n@docs field\n\n\n## View Functions\n\n@docs Context\n\n\n## Showing Errors\n\n@docs Errors, errorsForField\n\n\n## Rendering Forms\n\n@docs renderHtml, renderStyledHtml\n\n\n## Render Options\n\n@docs Options, options\n\n@docs withInput, withAction, withOnSubmit, withServerResponse\n\n@docs withGetMethod\n\n@docs Method, methodToString\n\n\n## Running Parsers\n\n@docs parse\n\n@docs Validated\n\n\n## Progressively Enhanced Form Techniques (elm-pages)\n\n\n### Hidden Fields\n\nHidden fields are a useful technique when you are progressively enhancing form submissions and sending the key-value form data directly.\nIn `elm-pages` apps this is used often and is an idiomatic approach.

If you are using a framework that is integrated with `elm-form` (such as `elm-pages`), then you can\nrely on the framework's onSubmit behavior. Otherwise, you will need to do something with the form when there is a valid form submission.\n\nThere are a few different approaches you can use.\n\n1.  Progressively enhance the raw FormData submission. Since `withOnSubmit` gives you access to `{ fields : List ( String, String ) {- ... -} }`, you can propagate the raw key-value pairs (`fields`) and send those to your API. If you are doing full-stack Elm with `elm-pages` or Lamdera, then this can be a great fit because you can do code sharing and re-use your `Form` definition on the backend to parse the raw FormData. However, you may not want to use this approach with frontend-only Elm because you may prefer to communicate with your backend using more structured data like JSON rather than FormData (which is just key-value strings).\n2.  Parse into your preferred type, then with an on-submit Msg, check if the data is `Valid`, and if it is, use the parsed data to make a request to your API (by JSON-encoding the value, building a GraphQL request, etc.).\n3.  In your Form's `combine`, directly parse into a representation of your request, such as a `Json.Encode.Value`, a `Cmd Msg`, a `Task error Msg`, or an intermediary data type that represents an API request.\n\nLet's look at an example of approach (3). In this example, we define a `Request` record alias which represents an API request. Note, there is nothing special about this `Request` type, this is just\nan example ot illustrate this general pattern, but consider the best types for your use case when you adapt this example for your app.\n\n    import Form\n    import Form.Field as Field\n    import Form.Validation as Validation\n\n    type alias Request =\n        { path : String\n        , body : Encode.Value\n        , expect : Http.Expect Msg\n        }\n\n    sendRequest : Request -> Cmd Msg\n    sendRequest request =\n        Http.post\n            { url = \"https://myservice.com/api\" ++ request.path\n            , body = Http.jsonBody request.body\n            , expect = request.expect\n            }\n\n    userProfileForm : Form.HtmlForm String Request input msg\n    userProfileForm =\n        (\\name email ->\n            { combine =\n                Validation.succeed\n                    (\\nameValue emailValue ->\n                        { path = \"/api/user\"\n                        , body =\n                            Encode.object\n                                [ ( \"name\", Encode.string nameValue )\n                                , ( \"email\", Encode.string emailValue )\n                                ]\n                        }\n                    , expect = Http.expectJson GotUpdatedProfile profileDecoder\n                    )\n                    |> Validation.andMap name\n                    |> Validation.andMap email\n            , view = \\context -> [{- ... view here -}]\n            }\n        )\n            |> Form.form\n            |> Form.field \"name\" (Field.text |> Field.required \"Required\")\n            |> Form.field \"email\" (Field.text |> Field.required \"Required\")\n\n","type":"({ fields : List.List ( String.String, String.String ), method : Form.Method, action : String.String, parsed : Form.Validated error parsed } -> msg) -> Form.Options error parsed input oldMsg -> Form.Options error parsed input msg"},{"name":"withServerResponse","comment":" You can render your `Form` with an initial set of values and errors that semantically represent a server response.\n\nConceptually, this is like sending a traditional form submission to a backend.

In the happy path on the Browser this will never happen.\n\nHowever, you can't make any assumptions about the client (non-standard clients could be used), or about the data format that is sent to servers.\nOften validation logic is duplicated to guard against this on both the client (display useful validation feedback for the user) and the server (validate untrusted input).\nIf you use full-stack Elm, you can use your Form definition on your server to run the same code that\nyou use to present validation errors on the client, allowing you to keep the validations in sync.\n\nHere is an example that showcases different types of Fields (`text`, `date`, `time`, and `checkbox`), as well as how to use the `combine` function to\ntransform the parsed values and perform additional validations between the parsed fields.\n\n    import Date exposing (Date)\n    import Form\n    import Form.Field as Field\n    import Form.Validation as Validation\n\n    type alias Stay =\n        { name : String\n        , checkIn : Checkin\n        , emailUpdates : Bool\n        }\n\n    type alias Checkin =\n        { date : Date\n        , nights : Int\n        , time : TimeOfDay\n        }\n\n    example : Form.HtmlForm String Stay input Msg\n    example =\n        (\\name checkIn checkOut checkInTime emailUpdates ->\n            { combine =\n                Validation.succeed Stay\n                    |> Validation.andMap name\n                    |> Validation.andMap\n                        (Validation.succeed\n                            (\\checkinValue checkoutValue checkInTimeValue ->\n                                Validation.succeed\n                                    { date = checkinValue\n                                    , nights = Date.toRataDie checkoutValue - Date.toRataDie checkinValue\n                                    , time = checkInTimeValue\n                                    }\n                                    |> Validation.withErrorIf (Date.toRataDie checkinValue >= Date.toRataDie checkoutValue) checkIn \"Must be before checkout\"\n                            )\n                            |> Validation.andMap checkIn\n                            |> Validation.andMap checkOut\n                            |> Validation.andMap checkInTime\n                            |> Validation.andThen identity\n                        )\n                    |> Validation.andMap emailUpdates\n            , view =\n                \\formState ->\n                    let\n                        fieldView label field =\n                            Html.div []\n                                [ Html.label []\n                                    [ Html.text (label ++ \" \")\n                                    , FieldView.input [] field\n                                    , errorsView formState field\n                                    ]\n                                ]\n                    in\n                    [ fieldView \"Name\" name\n                    , fieldView \"Check-In\" checkIn\n                    , fieldView \"Check-Out\" checkOut\n                    , fieldView \"Check-In Time\" checkInTime\n                    , fieldView \"Sign Up For Email Updates\" emailUpdates\n                    , Html.button [] [ Html.text \"Submit\" ]\n                    ]\n            }\n        )\n            |> Form.form\n            |> Form.field \"name\"\n                (Field.text\n                    |> Field.required \"Required\"\n                )\n            |> Form.field \"checkin\"\n                (Field.date\n                    { invalid = \\_ -> \"Invalid\" }\n                    |> Field.required \"Required\"\n                    |> Field.withMin today (\"Must be after \" ++ Date.toIsoString today)\n                )\n            |> Form.field \"checkout\"\n                (Field.date\n                    { invalid = \\_ -> \"Invalid\" }\n                    |> Field.required \"Required\"\n                )\n            |> Form.field \"checkinTime\"\n                (Field.time\n                    { invalid = \\_ -> \"Invalid\" }\n                    |> Field.required \"Required\"\n                    |> Field.withMin { hours = 10, minutes = 0 } \"Must be after today\"\n                )\n            |> Form.field \"emailUpdates\"\n                Field.checkbox\n\n    today : Date\n    today =\n        Date.fromRataDie 738624\n\nThe key concepts to understand here are where the view and validation logic for fields lives.\n\nThe `Form`'s `view` function is responsible for combining the rendered Fields, but the `Field` contains the information for how to display\nthe form field itself (details like like `<input type=\"date\">`, `<input type=\"checkbox\">`, `<textarea>` etc.). Since form fields contain both\ndisplay logic that changes how we parse/validate the field, all of the parsing and validation logic related to displaying the\nField is also defined with `Field` type. For example, `Field.withMin` contains information that is used both for displaying the form field and for\nvalidating it. When we set `Field.withMin`, it gives the Browser information on how to restrict the date picker UI from showing\ninvalid dates, but setting that minimum value also runs that validation when we run the Form parser, even if we run it\non a server through code sharing.\n\nNote that the validations in a `Field`s definition (such as `Field.withMin`, or `Field.date`, etc.) are run\nregardless of whether you use that field in the Form's `combine` function.\n\n","args":["error","parsed","input","initial","kind","constraints"],"type":"Internal.Field.Field error parsed input initial kind constraints"},{"name":"TimeOfDay","comment":" A time of day in 24-hour time.\n\nThe hours must be between 0 and 23, and the minutes must be between 0 and 59.\n\nThis is the type that a `time` field parses into, and is also used to set initial values and minimum/maximum values for `time`.\n\nSee <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#time_strings>\n\n","args":[],"type":"{ hours : Basics.Int, minutes : Basics.Int, seconds : Maybe.Maybe Basics.Int }"}],"values":[{"name":"checkbox","comment":" Renders a checkbox input (`<input type=\"checkbox\">`), see <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox>.\n\n    import Form.Field as Field\n\n    example =\n        Field.checkbox\n\n","type":"Form.Field.Field error Basics.Bool input Basics.Bool Form.FieldView.Input { required : () }"},{"name":"date","comment":" A date field.

It's a little confusing that this `Field`\ntype serves two purposes, but it allows us to have a safe way to reference a Form's fields, and doesn't require two\ndeclarations with a duplicate parameter list.\n\nSee the [`Form`](Form) docs for more on how to use `Field`s to render your `Form`'s view and define its `combine` `Validation`.\n\n","args":["error","parsed","kind"],"type":"Form.Validation.Validation error parsed kind { field : kind }"},{"name":"Validation","comment":" A `Validation` represents a parsed value or a list of errors.\n","args":["error","parsed","kind","constraints"],"type":"Pages.Internal.Form.Validation error parsed kind constraints"}],"values":[{"name":"andMap","comment":" Lets you combine Validation's in a pipeline.\n\n    import Form\n    import Form.Field as Field\n    import Form.Validation as Validation\n\n    example =\n        (\\first middle last ->\n            { combine =\n                Validation.succeed\n                    (\\first middle last ->\n                        first ++ \" \" ++ middle ++ \" \" ++ last\n                    )\n                    |> Validation.andMap first\n            , view = \\_ -> []\n            }\n        )\n            |> Form.form\n            |> Form.field \"first\" (Field.text |> Field.required \"Required\")\n            |> Form.field \"middle\" (Field.text |> Field.required \"Required\")\n            |> Form.field \"last\" (Field.text |> Field.required \"Required\")\n\n","type":"Form.Validation.Validation error a named1 constraints1 -> Form.Validation.Validation error (a -> b) named2 constraints2 -> Form.Validation.Combined error b"},{"name":"andThen","comment":" Continue a `Validation` based on the given `parsed` value.\n\n    import Date\n    import Form\n    import Form.Field as Field\n    import Form.Validation as Validation\n\n    example : Form.HtmlForm String { date : Date, nights : Int } input msg\n    example =\n        (\\checkIn checkOut ->\n            { combine =\n                Validation.map2\n                    (\\checkinValue checkoutValue ->\n                        Validation.succeed\n                            { date = checkinValue\n                            , nights = Date.toRataDie checkoutValue - Date.toRataDie checkinValue\n                            }\n                            |> Validation.withErrorIf (Date.toRataDie checkinValue >= Date.toRataDie checkoutValue) checkIn \"Must be before checkout\"\n                    )\n                    checkIn\n                    checkOut\n                    |> Validation.andThen identity\n            , view = \\_ -> []\n            }\n        )\n            |> Form.form\n            |> Form.field \"checkin\"\n                (Field.date\n                    { invalid = \\_ -> \"Invalid\" }\n                    |> Field.required \"Required\"\n                )\n            |> Form.field \"checkout\"\n                (Field.date\n                    { invalid = \\_ -> \"Invalid\" }\n                    |> Field.required \"Required\"\n                )\n\n","type":"(parsed -> Form.Validation.Validation error mapped named1 constraints1) -> Form.Validation.Validation error parsed named2 constraints2 -> Form.Validation.Combined error mapped"},{"name":"fail","comment":" Add an error to the given `Field`, short-circuiting its parsed value so that it will fail to parse.\nThis can be helpful if you want to fail with a value that you can combine together with other values because\nit has an unbound `parsed` type variable.
